This document is work in progress, and contains an extended description of the equations and derivations related to the SPIDER code \citep{BSW18}.  It essentially covers the physics and mathematics in more depth than is covered in \cite{ABE93,ABE95,BSW18}.  In fact, the notes in this document apply much more broadly than for just the SPIDER code, since they present the conservation equations for a multi-component system and are hence generally applicable to a range of fluid dynamical applications.  For example, this theory will also be applicable to recent melting and energy transport implementations in StagYY \citep{TACK08}.  There remains duplication of material in this document and several sections need to be reorganised.
