These should form the basis for code testing and production models:

1. Template input files for other users to adapt
1. Reproducability of published models
1. Ensure models are valgrind clean

Please follow this format:

1. Create a new main directory for the models that you wish to contribute.  I typically adopt a format of date\_author under the assumption that the models are or will be published.
1. Create subdirectories within that main directory and add a README.md (if desired) to describe the models
1. Within each subdirectory, include the input parameter file and another README.md for model-specific notes
