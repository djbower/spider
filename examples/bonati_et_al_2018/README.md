Example input files for models with different Earth-radii and using the Zahnle parameterised steam atmosphere model (or black body, in one extra test case).  These are repeat cases in order to include the effect of the ultra-thin thermal boundary layer at the top of the magma ocean in the revised version of Bonati et al., (2018).  An older version of the code did not include the boundary layer for certain surface boundary conditions (even if the user thought they had turned it on), which is why these runs were repeated.  In fact, many of the models run by Irene were using the (even older) prototype python code.
