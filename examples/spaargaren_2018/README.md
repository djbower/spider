These examples were constructed as part of the thesis work of Rob Spaargaren (ETHZ, 2018).  These examples use SPIDER to model (parameterised) solid-state convection, culminating in models with (stagnant) and without (plate tectonic/mobile) a viscous lid.

In particular, ex\_Earth\_lid and ex\_Earth\_plate show the parameters used for the production models in Rob's thesis.  E.g., see Figures 4.7 and 4.8 in his thesis.
