The following should work to clone the maint branch and build. You
should change the C/C++/Fortran compilers to whatever works on your
system:

cd /somewhere/to/install
git clone https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc -b maint petsc-maint
cd petsc-maint
[See below for Petsc configure for double or quad precision]

Then follow the instructions to build and test a debug build. It will
produce a directory called arch-some-stuff which will be your
PETSC_ARCH, and PETSC_DIR is the directory named "petsc-maint" above.
If you set those, you should be able to build and play with the tests,
for example

    cd $PETSC_DIR/src/ts/examples/tutorials
    make ex1
    ./ex1 -ts_monitor -ts_view -ts_type sundials

The connection here is glacial so I haven't directly tested the above
- apologies in advance when it fails but give it a shot!

If you want master, repeat the above but without the "-b maint" in the
"git clone" command, and with petsc-master as the directory name. You
can then have parallel builds of the two versions of the library.
Better to use maint until we need something specific from master 

for configuring petsc with double precision:

./configure PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-c --download-mpich --download-sundials --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran --with-debugging=0 --FOPTFLAGS='-g -O3' --COPTFLAGS='-g -O3' --CXXOPTFLAGS='-g -O3'
make PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-c

for configuring petsc with quad precision:

./configure PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-c-quad --with-precision=__float128 --download-f2cblaslapack --download-mpich --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran --with-debugging=0 --FOPTFLAGS='-g -O3' --COPTFLAGS='-g -O3' --CXXOPTFLAGS='-g -O3'
make PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-c-quad

for debugging build, use --with-debugging=1
