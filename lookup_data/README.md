1TPa-dK09-elec-free/ directory contains the lookup data for MgSiO3.

The solid data is from Mosenfelder et al. (2009): https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008JB005900

The melt data is from Wolf and Bower (2018): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920117301449?via%3Dihub.  They are derived by fitting the MD simulation results of de Koker and Stixrude (2009).  An electronic entropy contribution is not included, but could in principle be relevant at very high pressure.  See Wolf and Bower (2018) for details.

The melting curves (solidus and liquidus) are a combination of the smooth curve presented in Hamano et al. (2013) (supplementary: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12163#MOESM70) for the upper mantle, and the lower mantle from Andrault et al. (2011), https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X1100077X.  The mixed phase region properties are computed using the values of properties at the solidus and liquidus and some weighting criteria.  See Bower et al. (2018) for details.

Within the 1TPa-dK09-elec-free/ directory there is a directory for lookup by entropy, and a directory for lookup by temperature.
